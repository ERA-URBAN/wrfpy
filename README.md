# WRFpy
### What is WRFpy:
WRFpy is a python application that provides an easy way to set up, run,
and monitor (long) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations. It 
provides a simple user-editable JSON configuration file and integrates
with Cylc to access distributed computing and storage resources as well as monitoring. 
Optionally, WRFpy allows for data assimilation using WRF data assimilation
system (WRFDA) and postprocessing of wrfinput files using the NCEP Unified 
Post Processing System (UPP).
